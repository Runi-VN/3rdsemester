Numbers are what exercise the tasks belong to.  

As mentioned in the wiki, I had a lot of issues with this repository.  

I basically can't delete any of this, as they are connected by submodule(???) (Deleting any of the extra repositores deletes its connection too).  
It is NOT fun!

`1 - backup:`  
Ignore

`1 - SP5_AJAX_CORS`:  
Exercise 1, SPA to create the SVG map  

`2 - REST_JAX_RS_CONTINUED`:  
Exercise 2 - Old project to be used for the Javascript exercise.  

`2 - SPA`:  
Exercise 2 - New SPA containing index.html and index.js for the above project. Fetches through vagrant and persists too.  

`2 - SPA_new`:  
Ignore. Backup of above repository. Connected, so if I delete one or the other, they both go. Idk what to do here
