-   What is your public IP address right now, and how did you find it?  

With the use of the Command Prompt and the command **ipconfig** I got the following results:  
School: 10.50.138.198  
Home:  
    
-   What is your private IP address right now (do this both at home and in school), and who/what gave you that address?  

With the use of the Command Prompt and the command **ipconfig** I got the following results:  
School: 192.168.56.1  
Home: 
-   What’s special about these address ranges?
    
      -   10.0.0.0 – 10.255.255.255
      -   172.16.0.0 – 172.31.255.255
      -   192.168.0.0 – 192.168.255.255
      
Private range IPs (**elaborate**)
    
-   What’s special about this ip-address: 127.0.0.1?
    
-   What kind of service would you expect to find on a server using these ports: 22, 23, 25, 53, 80, 443?  

Port 22 is used for the SSH (Secure Shell) Remote Login Protocol.  
Port 23 is used for the Telnet protocol. 
Port 25 is used for the SMTP (Simlple Mail Transfer Protocol) Protocol.  
Port 53 is used for the DNS (Domain Name System) Protocol.  
Port 80 is used for the HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) Protocol.  
Port 443 is used for the HTTPS/SSL (Secure Socket Layer).  
    
-   What is the IP address of studypoints.dk and how did you find it?
    
-   If you write https://studypoints.dk in your browser, how did “it” figure out that it should go to the IP address you discovered above?
    
-   Explain shortly the purpose of an ip-address and a port-number and why we need both
    
-   What is your (nearest) DNS server,?
    
-   What is (conceptually) the DNS system and the purpose with a DNS Server?
    
-   What is your current Gateway, and how did you find it?
    
-   What is the address of your current DHCP-Server, and how did you find it?
    
-   Explain (conceptually) about the TCP/IP-protocol stack
    
-   Explain about the HTTP Protocol (the following exercises will go much deeper into this protocol)
    
-   Explain (conceptually) how HTTP and TCP/IP are connected (what can HTTP do, and where does it fit into TCP/IP)
